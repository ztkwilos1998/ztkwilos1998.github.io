			<h2>Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
			<p>
				What you're looking at right now is Zachary Kwilos' personal website, created in his CSE 199 Class, and improvised to fit for the final project.
				It came a long way from being a virtually empty window minus the tiny text that said "hello world!" and now it's practically a functioning website. Pretty cool!
			</p>
		
			<p> 
				This website here is pretty much my own litte electronic resume, which I can constantly keep updating and improving for the future!

			<h2> A Little Bit About Myself...</h2>
			<p>
			Well, you may already know this but my name is Zach. I'm really into computers, so I knew this class would be there perfect class for me and it turns out it was!
			Ever since I was a young lad, I always had this dream to work on and build computers. In general, learn about computers inside and out. I knew that the
			University at Buffalo would be a great fit for me due to their strong Computer Scince field.

			<h2>About CSE199...</h2>
			<p>
				This year, a brand new course was formed at University at Buffalo. It was a seminar made for computer science students called "How the Internet Works."
				It covered a broad range of topics, like learning what a client is, what a server is, or even something as simple as how email works. Turns out it's not
				as simple as you may think it is. 
				
				Here's what the internet course review section looked like,Interesting....
